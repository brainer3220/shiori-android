  - `docs/.ralph/runs/run-20260306-222712-39971-iter-6.log`
- What was implemented
  - Expanded `MainActivityTest` to cover shared auto-save failures for unauthorized, conflict, rate-limited, and network responses while asserting the imported request still uses the existing save workflow with `title = null` and `read = false`.
  - Re-verified the required cold-launch share import, deep-link import, missing access, and unsupported shared content paths remain covered in instrumentation tests.
  - Confirmed the implementation still routes shared URLs through the main add-link flow, refreshes the inbox after save, and surfaces user-visible status text for success and duplicate outcomes.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
    - Shared-import coverage is easiest to extend by driving `MainActivity` with real share intents and stubbing `FakeLinksRepository.saveResult` per API outcome.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - `./gradlew test` was flaky after earlier parallel Gradle work; `./gradlew clean test` ran reliably.
    - `./gradlew lintDebug` still passes, but AndroidX lint jars emit Java runtime compatibility warnings during analysis in this environment.
  - Useful context
    - The repo-level `ralph` helper at `/Users/brainer/Programming/shiori-android/ralph` appends to the tracked root `.ralph/activity.log`.

- What was implemented
  - Restricted `Intent.ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` to unsupported feedback for v1 so the app never attempts batched saves from multi-share payloads.
  - Preserved pending shared URLs through access setup, then resumed the existing save workflow once valid API access was saved.
  - Added duplicate-intent guards so a repeated cold-launch or follow-up intent for the same URL does not trigger a second save.
  - Expanded instrumentation coverage for unsupported multi-share input, deferred save until access setup, and duplicate intent regression handling.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
    - Shared URL handling is safest when intent intake only stages a pending URL and reuses the normal validated save path after the browser screen opens.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - Running Gradle quality gates in parallel can corrupt incremental Android resource work directories; sequential runs were stable.
    - `./gradlew lintDebug` still passes here, but AndroidX lint jars emit Java runtime compatibility warnings during analysis.
  - Useful context
    - The repo-level `ralph` helper exists at `/Users/brainer/Programming/shiori-android/ralph`; running it from `docs` writes to `docs/.ralph/activity.log`.

## [2026-03-06 23:22:40] - US-002: Align POST /api/links client

  - `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/dev/shiori/android/MainActivityTest.kt`
  - `docs/.ralph/activity.log`
  - `docs/.ralph/progress.md`
- What was implemented
  - Aligned `CreateLinkRequest` with the documented POST contract by sending only `url`, optional `title`, and optional `read`.
  - Updated create-link parsing to accept `success`, opaque `linkId`, and optional `duplicate`, then routed save UX from request intent plus follow-up list refresh instead of assuming the POST returned hydrated link metadata.
  - Expanded client and app tests to verify POST path/auth/body, duplicate inbox behavior, and create-link error mapping including network failures.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
    - The save flow can infer destination from the outgoing request, while authoritative link details should come from the next list fetch.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - `./gradlew test` initially failed because the mocked create-link JSON had a trailing comma; fixing the fixture resolved it.
    - `./gradlew lintDebug` succeeds in this environment but emits dependency lint-loader warnings because the installed Java runtime is older than some AndroidX lint jars.
  - Useful context
    - Running `./gradlew clean` before the quality gates avoided transient incremental build issues from earlier failed parallel Gradle work.
